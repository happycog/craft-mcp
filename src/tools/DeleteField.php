        Delete a field from Craft CMS. Field deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
        
        **WARNING**: Deleting a field will remove all content stored in that field across all entries.
        This action is permanent and cannot be undone.
        
        The tool will show which layouts and sections are using the field before deletion
        to help you understand the impact.
