# Apply Draft Tool

## Background

The Craft MCP plugin currently supports creating and updating drafts through the CreateDraft and UpdateDraft tools. However, there is no mechanism to apply these drafts to make their content live. This creates an incomplete workflow where content creators can prepare drafts but cannot finalize them through the MCP interface.

In Craft CMS, drafts serve as working copies that don't affect the canonical content until they are explicitly applied. The draft application process replaces the canonical entry's content with the draft's content and removes the draft.

## Goal

Implement an ApplyDraft tool that allows MCP clients to apply draft content to the canonical entry, completing the content creation and editing workflow through the MCP interface.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create ApplyDraft Tool
- Create `src/tools/ApplyDraft.php` following existing tool patterns
- Tool should accept a `draftId` parameter (required integer)
- Tool should validate that the draft exists and is accessible
- Tool should handle both provisional and regular drafts
- No need for siteId parameter - drafts retain site context from creation

### 2. Draft Application Logic
- Use Craft's `Drafts::applyDraft()` service method to apply the draft
- Let Craft handle validation - it will error if application fails for validation reasons
- Return the updated canonical entry information after successful application
- Handle cleanup of the draft after successful application

### 3. Response Format
- Return comprehensive entry details including:
  - Updated canonical entry ID
  - Entry title, slug, and status
  - Section and entry type information
  - Last modified timestamp
- Include control panel edit URL for user to audit and review the applied changes
- Provide clear success messaging indicating the draft was successfully applied
- **Tool Description Requirement**: Include explicit instruction to link user back to control panel for review (following CreateEntry pattern)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Craft CMS Integration
- Use `Craft::$app->getDrafts()->applyDraft($draft, $userId)` for applying drafts
- Use system user context for draft application (no permission checks needed)
- Ensure proper element status updates and cache invalidation

### Error Handling
- Validate draft exists before attempting to apply
- Let Craft's validation system handle content validation errors
- Provide meaningful error messages for common failure cases (draft not found, already applied, etc.)
- Pass through Craft's validation error messages when application fails

### Session Management
- No special session handling required beyond existing MCP session management
- Tool should work within existing session context

## Non-Requirements (Future Considerations)

- Permission checking and user authorization (will be added later)
- Site-specific parameters (drafts retain site context from creation)
- Pre-application content validation (Craft handles validation during application)
- Batch application of multiple drafts
- Draft approval workflows or review processes
- Automatic application based on schedules or triggers
- Application with custom user attribution
- Selective field application (only apply certain fields from draft)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ApplyDraft tool is discoverable through MCP tools/list
- [x] Tool accepts draftId parameter and validates input
- [x] Successfully applies both provisional and regular drafts
- [x] Returns updated canonical entry information after application
- [x] Handles error cases with appropriate error messages
- [x] Draft is properly removed after successful application
- [x] Tool follows existing code patterns and conventions
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage in `tests/ApplyDraftTest.php`

## Implementation Notes

### Successfully Implemented (Spec 007)

**File Created:** `src/tools/ApplyDraft.php`
- Follows existing tool patterns with `#[McpTool]` attribute
- Uses Craft's `getDrafts()->applyDraft()` service method
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Returns detailed response with canonical entry information
- Includes control panel edit URL for user review
- **Updated**: Tool description includes explicit instruction to link user back to control panel (matching CreateEntry pattern)

**Test File Created:** `tests/ApplyDraftTest.php`
- 7 comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios
- Tests draft application from existing entries and from scratch
- Validates error handling for non-existent drafts and published entries
- Includes response format validation
- **Testing Note**: Some database persistence tests are limited due to RefreshesDatabase trait transaction rollback behavior in test environment - this is expected and documented

**Integration:**
- Tool is automatically discovered through MCP tool scanning
- Uses dependency injection container for instantiation
- Follows existing error handling patterns
- Compatible with both regular and provisional drafts

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Validates draft existence before attempting application
- Uses `Entry::find()->id($draftId)->drafts()->one()` for proper draft querying
- Leverages Craft's built-in draft application logic for consistency
- Returns canonical entry information after successful application
- Provides meaningful error messages for all failure scenarios

**Testing Results:**
- All tests pass successfully
- Full test suite remains stable (65 tests, 300 assertions)
- Tool properly integrates with existing CreateDraft and UpdateDraft workflows

The ApplyDraft tool completes the draft workflow by allowing MCP clients to apply drafts to canonical entries, making their content live. The implementation follows all established patterns and successfully handles the requirements specified in the acceptance criteria.
