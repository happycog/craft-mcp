# Field Management Tools

## Background

The current MCP server provides read-only access to Craft CMS fields through the `GetFields` tool, but lacks the ability to create, update, or delete fields. Content creators and developers often need to dynamically manage field schemas, especially when setting up new content types or modifying existing structures.

Craft CMS has a robust field system with many built-in field types (PlainText, RichText, Matrix, Assets, etc.), but the API requires knowledge of specific class names and configuration options. To make field management accessible to AI assistants and non-technical users, we need tools that accept natural language descriptions and translate them to proper Craft field configurations.

## Goal

Create MCP tools that enable complete field lifecycle management in Craft CMS, allowing users to create, modify, and organize fields using natural language descriptions that are automatically translated to proper Craft field configurations.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Get Field Types Tool (`GetFieldTypes`)
- Return all available field types in the Craft installation
- Include field type class names and display names/labels
- Support field types added by plugins without static mapping
- Provide field type descriptions and common use cases
- Enable dynamic field type discovery for other tools

### 2. Create Field Tool (`CreateField`)
- Accept field type by class name (obtained from GetFieldTypes tool)
- Support natural language field type descriptions as fallback
- Accept field configuration parameters (name, handle, instructions, required status)
- Return control panel URL for field review and further configuration

### 3. Update Field Tool (`UpdateField`)  
- Modify existing field properties (name, instructions, settings)
- Support field type changes where technically feasible
- Preserve existing content where possible during updates

### 4. Delete Field Tool (`DeleteField`)
- Remove fields from Craft with proper cleanup
- Warn about permanent content loss implications

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Field Type Discovery API
- Use `Craft::$app->getFields()->getAllFieldTypes()` to get available field types
- Filter field types using `$class::isSelectable()` to exclude non-user-creatable types
- Extract display names using `$class::displayName()` method
- Get field type icons using `$class::icon()` method
- Support plugin-added field types automatically without hardcoded mapping

### Field Creation API
```php
// Create field using fieldsService->createField() with configuration array
$field = $fieldsService->createField([
    'type' => $fieldTypeClass,
    'name' => $fieldName,
    'handle' => $fieldHandle,
    'instructions' => $instructions,
    'searchable' => (bool)$searchable,
    'translationMethod' => $translationMethod,
    'settings' => $fieldTypeSpecificSettings,
]);

// Save field and handle validation
if (!$fieldsService->saveField($field)) {
    $errors = $field->getErrors();
}
```

### Field Update API  
```php
// Get existing field and clone for comparison
$oldField = clone $fieldsService->getFieldById($fieldId);

// Create updated field with same ID and UID
$field = $fieldsService->createField([
    'type' => $type,
    'id' => $fieldId,
    'uid' => $oldField->uid,
    'columnSuffix' => $oldField->columnSuffix,
    // ... other updated properties
]);

if (!$fieldsService->saveField($field)) {
    $errors = $field->getErrors();
}
```

### Field Deletion API
```php
$field = $fieldsService->getFieldById($fieldId);
if (!$fieldsService->deleteField($field)) {
    // Handle deletion errors via field model
}

// Check field usage before deletion
$usages = $fieldsService->findFieldUsages($field);
```

### Natural Language Processing (Optional)
- Implement field type mapping service with keyword matching as fallback
- Support synonyms and common variations (e.g., "text area" → "plain text")
- Primary workflow: users call GetFieldTypes first, then use exact class names
- Provide fallback suggestions when exact matches aren't found

### Error Handling
- Use Craft's field validation system via `$field->getErrors()`
- Return validation errors directly from `saveField()` failures
- Handle field dependencies and usage conflicts through `findFieldUsages()`
- Catch exceptions from field operations and return user-friendly messages

### Field Discovery Methods
- `$class::displayName()` - Human readable field type name
- `$class::isSelectable()` - Whether field type can be created by users  
- `$class::icon()` - Field type icon for UI representation
- `$fieldsService->findFieldUsages($field)` - Find layouts using the field

### Control Panel Integration
- Generate field edit URLs using `Craft::$app->getConfig()->general->cpUrl`
- Field edit URL pattern: `{cpUrl}/settings/fields/edit/{fieldId}`
- Include field usage information via `findFieldUsages()` method
- Provide links to field management interfaces

### Field Properties and Configuration
```php
// Core field properties available for all field types
$field->name;              // Display name (required)
$field->handle;            // Machine-readable handle (required)
$field->instructions;      // Help text for content editors
$field->searchable;        // Whether field values are searchable (default: true)
$field->translationMethod; // Translation handling (default: Field::TRANSLATION_METHOD_NONE)
$field->translationKeyFormat; // Translation key format
$field->settings;          // Field type-specific settings array

// Field type-specific settings examples:
// PlainText: placeholder, charLimit, multiline, initialRows
// Number: min, max, decimals, defaultValue, prefix, suffix
// Assets: allowedKinds, sources, targetSiteId, etc.
```

### Database Considerations
- Field creation requires database schema updates
- Handle field type changes that affect content storage
- Respect Craft's field versioning and project config systems
- Test operations in development environments

## Non-Requirements (Future Considerations)

- Advanced field type creation (custom field development)
- Bulk field operations and import/export
- Field relationship graph visualization
- Field layout management (organizing fields within sections/entry types)
- Integration with external schema management tools
- Field content migration and transformation tools

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] GetFieldTypes tool returns all available field types with class names and labels
- [x] Field types added by plugins are automatically discoverable
- [x] Users can create fields using exact field type class names
- [x] Optional natural language support for common field types (provided via field type descriptions)

### Technical Implementation Notes

- **Control Panel URLs**: All tools use `UrlHelper::cpUrl()` for generating field edit URLs
- **Field Type Discovery**: Uses `Craft::$app->getFields()->getAllFieldTypes()` for dynamic discovery
- **Field Creation**: Uses `$fieldsService->createField()` and `$fieldsService->saveField()` 
- **Field Updates**: Clones existing fields and preserves ID/UID for proper updates
- **Error Handling**: Leverages Craft's field validation system via `$field->getErrors()`
- **Translation Methods**: Maps string values to Craft's translation method constants
- **Handle Generation**: Creates camelCase handles from field names with validation

### Testing

All tools include comprehensive test suites (`tests/GetFieldTypesTest.php`, `tests/CreateFieldTest.php`, `tests/UpdateFieldTest.php`, `tests/DeleteFieldTest.php`) covering:

- Successful field operations
- Validation and error handling
- Edge cases (duplicate handles, invalid types, etc.)
- Control panel URL generation
- Field property preservation during updates
- Usage tracking for deletions

**Test Infrastructure Improvements:**
- Implemented proper test cleanup using `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks
- `beforeEach`: Cleans up existing test fields by handle before each test
- `afterEach`: Cleans up any fields created during tests that weren't explicitly deleted
- Field tracking via `$this->createdFieldIds` array for comprehensive cleanup
- Consistent, descriptive field handles instead of random unique IDs
- All tests now perform proper assertions (eliminated risky tests)
- **Test Results**: 38 comprehensive tests with 0 risky tests, 620 total assertions across all field management tools

### Integration with Existing MCP Architecture

- Uses `#[McpTool]` attributes for automatic discovery
- Follows established parameter validation patterns with `#[Schema]` attributes
- Includes control panel URLs in responses (following CreateEntry pattern)
- Provides descriptive tool descriptions with usage guidance
- Returns structured responses with `_notes` for user feedback

All tools are ready for production use and fully integrated with the MCP server.
