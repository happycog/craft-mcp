# add session handling

we've implemented the php-mcp/server transport layer but left the session handling as an in-memory array. this doesnt work across multiple requests.

we need to add a yii bassed session manager. we can use Yii's session support or its cache layer to manage it ourselves

you can find a Laravel example in samples/php-mcp-laravel/src/Session/DatabaseSessionHandler.php

remember this should be converted from laravel to yii

use the context from all other prompt files

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED ✅

### What was implemented:

1. **CraftSessionHandler** (`src/session/CraftSessionHandler.php`)
   - Implements SessionHandlerInterface for MCP server integration
   - Uses Craft's cache component for persistent session storage
   - Supports configurable TTL and cache key prefixes
   - Provides session ID generation using Craft's StringHelper

2. **Updated StreamableHttpServerTransport** (`src/transports/StreamableHttpServerTransport.php`)
   - Integrated with custom session handler
   - Proper session lifecycle management (only emit client_connected for initialize requests)
   - Support for both Mcp-Session-Id headers and sessionId query parameters
   - Session ID returned in response headers for initialize requests
   - Separated SSE message queuing from MCP session persistence

3. **Updated Plugin Configuration** (`src/Plugin.php`)
   - Configured MCP server to use custom session handler via withSessionHandler()
   - Proper dependency injection for session handler and transport
   - Clean integration between server protocol and transport

4. **Updated Tests** (`tests/StreamableHttpServerTransportTest.php`)
   - Fixed test to match new session behavior
   - Validate proper session ID handling for different request types
   - Ensure session persistence across requests

### Key Features:
- Persistent session storage using Craft's cache system
- Proper MCP protocol compliance (initialize -> initialized -> tools/list flow)
- Session management integration with php-mcp/server's SessionManager
- Support for both manual curl testing and MCP inspector workflow
- Clean separation between transport-level SSE queuing and protocol-level session state

### Testing Results:
- ✅ Manual session testing: Initialize -> Initialized -> Tools/List works perfectly
- ✅ Session persistence across multiple requests confirmed
- ✅ All transport tests passing (11/11)
- ✅ Session ID generation and storage working correctly
- ✅ Proper integration with MCP server's Protocol and SessionManager

### Session Flow:
1. Client sends initialize request (no session ID)
2. Server generates new session ID and emits client_connected
3. Protocol creates session via SessionManager with persistent handler
4. Initialize response includes Mcp-Session-Id header
5. Subsequent requests use session ID (header or query param)
6. Session state persists across requests via Craft cache
7. Session marked as initialized after notifications/initialized

The session handling now properly persists across multiple HTTP requests, solving the original problem of in-memory-only sessions.
